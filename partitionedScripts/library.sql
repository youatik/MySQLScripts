First invented in the 1970s, make still turns up to this day as the central engine in most programming projects; it even builds the Linux kernel. In the third edition of the classic Managing Projects with Gnu make, readers will learn why this utility continues to hold its top position in project build software, despite many younger competitors. The premise behind make is simple: after you change source files and want to rebuild your program or other output files, make checks timestamps to see what has changed and rebuilds just what you need, without wasting time rebuilding other files. But on top of this simple principle, make layers a rich collection of options that lets you manipulate multiple directories, build different versions of programs for different platforms, and customize your builds in other ways. This edition focuses on the Gnu version of make, which has deservedly become the industry standard. Gnu make contains powerful extensions that are explored in this book. It is also popular because it is free software and provides a version for almost every platform, including a version for Microsoft Windows as part of the free Cygwin project. Managing Projects with Gnu make, 3rd Edition provides guidelines on meeting the needs of large, modern projects. Also added are a number of interesting advanced topics such as portability, parallelism, and use with Java.

The most common operation done with sed is substitution, replacing one block of text with another. awk is a complete programming language. Unlike many conventional languages, awk is &quot;data driven&quot; - you specify what kind of data you are interested in and the operations to be performed when that data is found. awk does many things for you, including automatically opening and closing data files, reading records, breaking the records up into fields, and counting the records. While awk provides the features of most conventional programming languages, it also includes some unconventional features, such as extended regular expression matching and associative arrays. sed &amp; awk describes both programs in detail and includes a chapter of example sed and awk scripts. This edition covers features of sed and awk that are mandated by the Posix standard. This most notably affects awk, where Posix standardized a new variable, Convfmt, and new functions, toupper () and tolower (). The Convfmt variable specifies the conversion format to use when converting numbers to strings ( awk used to use Ofmt for this purpose). The toupper () and tolower () functions each take a (presumably mixed case) string argument and return a new version of the string with all letters translated to the corresponding case. In addition, this edition covers Gnu sed, newly available since the first edition. It also updates the first edition coverage of Bell Labs nawk and Gnu awk ( gawk ), covers mawk, an additional freely available implementation of awk, and briefly discusses three commercial versions of awk, Mks awk, Thompson Automation awk ( tawk ), and Videosoft (Vsawk).','O''Reilly Media','1997-03-08',54.25,434);

It now uses Python, instead of Ruby, as the lab software so that students can seamlessly transition from introductory projects to more advanced studies in later courses. The book also introduces Python programming, providing students with sufficient programming skills so they can implement their own programs. Practical, Step-by-Step Projects The interactive lab projects in each chapter allow students to examine important ideas in computer science, particularly how algorithms offer computational solutions to problems. Students can type expressions, view results, and run experiments that help them understand the concepts in a hands-on way. Web Resources The Python software modules for each lab project are available on the author''s website. The modules include data files and sample Python code that students can copy and modify. In addition, the site provides a lab manual of installation instructions and tips for editing programs and running commands in a terminal emulator.','CRC Press LLC','2014-09-24',54.875,439);

Although companies of every kind have successfully implemented his original design ideas across hundreds of systems, these insights have never before appeared in print. Based on first principles in software engineering and a comprehensive set of matching tools and techniques, Löwy''s methodology integrates system design and project design. First, he describes the primary area where many software architects fail and shows how to decompose a system into smaller building blocks or services, based on volatility. Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and risk; and how to devise multiple execution options. The method and principles in Righting Software apply regardless of your project and company size, technology, platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems and projects as well as careers-and possibly the software industry as a whole.

The book focuses on techniques of lasting value and explains them precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. The book presents all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework that shows their deep relationships and how and where to use them together.After an introduction to programming concepts, the book presents both well-known and lesser-known computation models (&quot;programming paradigms&quot;). Each model has its own set of techniques and each is included on the basis of its usefulness in practice. The general models include declarative programming, declarative concurrency, message-passing concurrency, explicit state, object-oriented programming, shared-state concurrency, and relational programming. Specialized models include graphical user interface programming, distributed programming, and constraint programming. Each model is based on its kernel language -- a simple core language that consists of a small number of programmer- significant elements. The kernel languages are introduced progressively, adding concepts one by one, thus showing the deep relationships between different models. The kernel languages are defined precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. Because a wide variety of languages and programming paradigms can be modeled by a small set of closely related kernel languages, this approach allows programmer and student to grasp the underlying unity of programming.

As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice , the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications.

H. S. Lahman shows how to address all these challenges by integrating proven object-oriented techniques with a powerful new methodology. "Model-Based Development" represents Lahman''s half century of experience as a pioneering software innovator. Building on Shlaer-Mellor''s work, Lahman''s unique approach fully delivers on the promise of models and is firmly grounded in the realities of contemporary development, design, and architecture.The book introduces the methodology''s core principles, showing how it separates each of a project''s concerns, enabling practitioners to optimize each domain for its unique needs and characteristics. Next, it demonstrates how to perform more effective object-oriented analysis, emphasizing abstraction, disciplined partitioning, modeling invariants, finite state machines, and efficient communications among program units. Coverage includesHow we got here: a historical perspective and pragmatic review of object principles Problem space versus computing space: reflecting crucial distinctions between customer and computer environments in your designsApplication partitioning: why it matters and how do it wellBuilding static models that describe basic application structureModeling classes, class responsibilities, associations, and both referential and knowledge integrityCreating dynamic models that describe behavior via finite state machinesSuccessfully using abstract action languages (AALs) and action data flow diagrams (ADFDs) Throughout, Lahman illuminates theoretical issues in practical terms, explaining why things are done as they are, without demanding rigorous math. His focus is on creating implementation-independent models that resolve functional requirements completely, precisely, and unambiguously. Whether you''re a developer, team leader, architect, or designer, Lahman''s techniques will help you build software that''s more robust, easier to maintain, supports larger-scale reuse, and whose specification is rigorous enough to enable full-scale automatic code generation.','Addison Wesley Professional','2011-06-14',70,560);

The book contains many exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.   Starting with basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic semantics are illustrated on a simple language of while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of Godel''s incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics, is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an introduction to the theory of computability based on while-programs.   Following a presentation of domain theory, the semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation. This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the proofs of the correspondence between the operation and denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on the use of information systems to represent domains. The book concludes with a chapter on parallel programming languages, accompanied by a discussion of methods for specifying and verifying nondeterministic and parallel programs.','The MIT Press','1993-02-05',48,384);

It''s reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn''t solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is "transparent" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique "tunneling" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you''re an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered.
